## Hi, I’m Prithvi 👋

Software engineer interested in **AI, SaaS, and developer tools**.

I like building **simple products** that make complex things easier, and contributing to open source to understand systems deeply. 

Long-term, I’m focused on building products people actually **love**.

- 🔭 Building and experimenting with ideas  
- 🌱 Exploring LLMs, applied AI, and product thinking  
- 🤝 Open to early-stage open source & builder collaborations
